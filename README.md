# data-cleaning-and-preprocessing-a-dataset

 Description:

This focuses on preparing raw data for machine learning by applying essential data cleaning and preprocessing techniques. Using Python along with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we perform a step-by-step transformation of a dataset (e.g., Titanic dataset) to make it suitable for model training. The key steps include:

   -Exploring and understanding the dataset structure and null values

   -Handling missing data using statistical imputation methods

   -Encoding categorical variables into numerical formats

   -Normalizing or standardizing numerical features

   -Detecting and removing outliers through visualization techniques

These preprocessing tasks are critical for improving model accuracy and ensuring consistent performance across different datasets.
